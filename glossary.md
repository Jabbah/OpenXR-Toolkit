#### DLSS

Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA RTX technology that uses the power of AI to boost your frame rates in games with graphically-intensive workloads. With DLSS, gamers can use higher resolutions and settings while still maintaining solid framerates.

#### FFR

Fixed Foveated Rendering is a type of Foveated Rendering rendering technique which doesn't utilise eye tracking and assumes a fixed focal point.

#### FSR

AMD FidelityFX™ Super Resolution (FSR) is AMD's open source, high-quality solution for producing high resolution frames from lower resolution inputs.

It uses a collection of cutting-edge algorithms with a particular emphasis on creating high-quality edges, giving large performance improvements compared to rendering at native resolution directly. FSR enables “practical performance” for costly render operations, such as hardware ray tracing.

#### NIS

NVidia Image Scaling (NIS) is an open source, best-in-class, spatial upscaler and sharpening algorithm that works cross-platform on all GPUs.

The NVIDIA Image Scaling SDK provides a single spatial scaling and sharpening algorithm for cross-platform support.

#### OpenXR

OpenXR is a structured set of instructions and rules for developers to create applications (such as Flight Simulator 2020) that use virtual reality or augmented reality (or XR as the industry calls it) that run on modern devices (such as the HP Reverb or Oculus Quest).

#### VRS and VRSS

Variable Rate Shading (VRS) and Variable Rate Supersampling (VRSS) are similar techniques used to allocate GPU rendering resources selectively.

VRS allows developers to selectively reduce the shading rate in areas of the frame where it won’t affect visual quality, letting them gain extra performance in their games. VRS also lets developers do the opposite: using an increased shading rate only in areas where it matters most, meaning even better visual quality in games.
