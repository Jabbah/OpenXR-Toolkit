## Disable in-game sharpening

Some users have reported better quality when disabling the in-game sharpening. This can be accomplished by manually editing the game's `UserCfg.opt` file.

**Prior to modifying the file, be sure to make a back-up copy**.

This file is located in a different folder depending on what store the game was purchased from.

For the Microsoft Store edition, the file is located at `C:\Users\your_login_name\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.FlightSimulator_#############\LocalCache\UserCfg.opt`.

For the Steam edition, the file is located at `C:\Users\your_login_name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\UserCfg.opt`.

Close Flight Simulator.

Open the file in a text editor (notepad will do if this is all you have available).

Locate the `{GraphicsVR` section.

In the `{PostProcess` subsection, set the value of `Sharpen` to 0.

```
{PostProcess
        Enabled 1
        EyeAdaptation 0
        ColorGrading 0
        Sharpen 0    <---
        Fringe 0
        LensDistortion 0
        Dirt 0
        LensFlare 0
        FilmGrain 0
        Vignette 0
        LensBlurMultiplier 1.000000
        FringeMultiplier 1.000000
    }
```

**Note:** If you are using the GeForce Experience automatic settings, this most likely cause your changes to the `UserCfg.opt` file to be erased in the future. You may want to consider disabling automatic settings.
